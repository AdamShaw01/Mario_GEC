## Mario_GEC
This project is for my Game Engine Creation module in semester 2 of my first year at university. It is a Mario clone using the SDL2 framework together with 
models and audio from the original NES game. I will try to create a functioning game that is playable by 2 players and wil end if the characters die.

### Difficulties I came across
Whilst making this project I encountered some difficulties that hindered my progress. These included the implementation of new SDL files to my project so that
I could include text into my game. I never resolved this problem so I moved to a new task. Next there was the movement of my Goombas that I added. They seemed 
to not move even though the code for them was very similair to the Koopas and they moved just fine. Furthermore, the character collision with the screen edges 
was a feature I couldn't seem to add. I tried to put it into the Character class, and then in the individual classes however I had no luck. I'm sure the code 
that I used was not correct and if I have time I will try to add it because the code is quite simple I just haven't figured it out yet.
